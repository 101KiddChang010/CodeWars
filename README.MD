# CodeWars
This is my respository to keep track of my CodeWars journey. I plan to do CodeWars Daily with any 
programming language I choose, and the goal is to learn a lot from this journey!

## Languages Used
* JavaScript
* Python
* Java
* C++
* Swift
* TypeScript

## Lessons Learned:

* I'm early in my journey, but this will teach me how to be commited and disciplined for my goal of daily 
coding.

* Swift file's naming convention is PascalCase, and won't be labeled as a swift file unless it's in PascalCase
